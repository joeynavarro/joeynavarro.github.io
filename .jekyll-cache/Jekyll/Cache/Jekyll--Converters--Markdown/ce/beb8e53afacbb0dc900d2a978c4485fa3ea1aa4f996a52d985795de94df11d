<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Using the Ames Housing Data from 2006-2010, build a linear regression model that will most accurately predict housing prices (given 82 housing features to select from and model with).</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This project was was to predict housing prices for Ames, Iowa, given a dataset from the Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office containing information on houses sold between 2006-2010 (<a href="http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt">data dictionary and information can be found here</a>.) My challenge was to build a linear regression model that would most accurately predict housing prices (given 80 housing features to select from and model with).</p>

<p>Key decisions I made during the modeling process:</p>

<p><strong>1. Filled null values with 0:</strong> I didnâ€™t drop columns with significant null values. When I examined the columns with nulls, I found most of them werenâ€™t really reflecting missing information but were input as â€˜NAâ€™ because a house didnâ€™t have that feature (ex. pool). I didnâ€™t feel it was necessary to treat categorical and numerical columns differently when filling â€˜nullâ€™ cells with 0 because I ultimately dummied out the categorical data anyway.</p>

<p><strong>2. Dropped Outliers:</strong> The data dictionary as well as subplots of the nominal data columns provided a clue on outliers in the data. Plotting sale price against above grade living area  and lot area narrow down the data in the dataset. According to the data dictionary, itâ€™s likely the outliers in our data were from unusual partial sales of large properties. I chose to remove the outliers to make the model better predict the majority of housing prices, and this did improve my modelâ€™s scores.</p>

<p><strong>4. Feature Selection:</strong> I had two feature models for my first model, I only included features that had an affect on the sale price according to an OLS hypothesis test. For my second feature model, I used every numerical feature and created a dummy columns dataframe  for nominal and ordinal features which was then concatinated to the trainning and testing dataframes. There were other features that I modified (ex. changed year built to decade and made this categorical) but in general I didnâ€™t drop features from the model. I scaled all the features but only used used polynomial features on the second features lasso model.</p>

<p><strong>5. Normalizing Features:</strong> Plotting the distribution of sale prices, there was a strong positive skew that was going to impact the skew of my residuals. I dealt with this by taking the natural log of saleprice (and reversing the log with np.exp after making predictions to convert them back into sale prices at the end) for the first feature models. I did not normalize the saleprice distribution for the second features model. I did normalize a positive skew first floor square foot distribution with a natural log to correct a positive skew on both features models.</p>

<p><strong>6. Linear, Lasso, Ridge Regression :</strong> I decided to use a linear, lasso, and ridge regression for the two feature selections I made in order to explore the best possible R2 results. The following were the cross validated scores for both features:</p>

<h3 id="conclusions--next-steps">Conclusions &amp; Next Steps</h3>

<p>Using a lasso regression along with a few data transformations, removal of extreme outliers, and the creation of dummy variables allowed me to fit a model that performed with an R2 value of  0.93.  The next steps are to attempt to predict the exact prices, I may want to try more advanced models or use classifying methods for variable selection.</p>
